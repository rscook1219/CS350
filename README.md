# CS350 - Secure Coding

- **Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
  - This project focused on developing a thermostat system that automatically controls temperature and communicates its status through UART, addressing the need for automated temperature regulation and remote status reporting.

- **What did you do particularly well?**
  - I effectively handled task scheduling, ensuring the system was responsive to inputs, accurately read temperatures, and transmitted data without causing delays.

- **Where could you improve?**
  - I could enhance my work on peripheral setup, especially with I2C, by dedicating more time to thorough configuration and testing uncommon scenarios.

- **What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**
  - I am incorporating more detailed technical documentation to assist in future embedded systems work.

- **What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**
  - Skills in task scheduling, integrating peripherals (like UART, I2C, and GPIO), and embedded C programming will be valuable for other embedded systems projects.

- **How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
  - By using a modular approach, writing clean code, and implementing non-blocking tasks, I made the system easier to manage, understand, and expand upon in the future.
